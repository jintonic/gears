The finish GroundFrontPainted represents a volume with a painted surface. The reflectivity 
ùëÖ defines the probability that an optical photon is reflected by the painted surface. More specifically, it is defined as 1 minus the absorption coefficient. The optical photon may or may not be absorbed by the paint. The paint is modeled through surface properties. When not absorbed, the photon undergoes Lambertian reflection. No refraction occurs.

Initially, a random number is generated. If the random number is greater than the sum of REFLECTIVITY and TRANSMITTANCE, the photon is absorbed. If the random number is not greater than the sum but is greater than REFLECTIVITY alone, the photon is transmitted. If the random number is not greater than REFLECTIVITY, the usual scattering calculation is performed.

Below are screenshots demonstrating different values for the various parameters

## Relctivity = 0 and Transmittance = 0 

As mentioned earlier, a reflectivity value of 0 and a transmittance value of 0 mean that none of the photons are reflected or transmitted. Therefore, based on the random number mechanism previously described, the photon is determined to be absorbed. As shown in the image below, the photon emitted from the CsI is absorbed upon reaching the CsI‚ÄìTeflon interface.

## Relctivity = 0 and Transmittance = 1 

In this case, all of the optical photons are transmitted through the interface without any reflection or absorption. The image shows photons freely crossing the CsI‚ÄìTeflon boundary.

### r05t05  

With equal values of reflectivity and transmittance, each photon has a 50% chance of being reflected or transmitted. The image demonstrates both transmitted and reflected photon trajectories originating from the CsI surface. Recall that the reflectio in this case is Lambertian.

### r1t0  

In this configuration, all photons are reflected at the interface. No transmission or absorption occurs, resulting in the Lambertian reflection of photons.
