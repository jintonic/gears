The finish GroundFrontPainted represents a volume with a painted surface. The reflectivity 
ùëÖ defines the probability that an optical photon is reflected by the painted surface. The optical photon may or may not be absorbed by the paint. The paint is modeled through surface properties. When not absorbed, the photon undergoes Lambertian reflection. No refraction occurs.


## Naming convention for example files
r - Reflectivity
t - transmittance 

## Example Parameters for r0t0.tg

## Define optical properties of a surface

First of all, there is no need to define a *surface* for polished interfaces between two media. As long as the two media have their refraction indices stored in their respective G4MaterialPropertiesTable, the [G4OpBoundaryProcess][]::[PostStepDoIt][] will handle the refraction and reflection correctly.

One can use the following syntax to define a [G4LogicalBorderSurface][] in case that there is a real need to specify the optical properties of the interface:

~~~cpp
//:surf v12v2 v1:copyNo1 v2:copyNo2
:surf CsI2Teflon CsI:1 Teflon:1
  type dielectric_dielectric
  model unified
  finish ground
  sigma_alpha 0.1
  property photon_energies 2 2.5*eV 5.0*eV
    REFLECTIVITY 0.9 0.9
//property must be the last setting due to the current coding method
~~~

Note that physics volumes from the same logical volume created by the text geometry processor share the same name as their logical volume. Since [G4LogicalBorderSurface][] requires pointers to the two physical volumes beside, a unique copy number has to be attached to the volume name to uniquely identify the physics volume.

Please read [the Geant4 manual](http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/TrackingAndPhysics/physicsProcess.html#boundary-process) if you would like to learn more about the optical interface models in Geant4.

You can also run example macros in the [surface/](surface/) directory to understand the difference between different surfaces.
